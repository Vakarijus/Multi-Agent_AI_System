# Multi-Agent_AI_System
 
Multi-agent AI System created with the ML-Agents package, in which two teams of agents compete in a strategic game where the main goal is to cover as much of the map as possible with the color of their team. The agents are trained to cooperate by using the POCA trainer type and a centralized critic, and compete by using the “Self-Play” method.
